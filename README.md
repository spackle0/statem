# Status Tiles
Experiment in consolidating status notifications from third parties.

## Challenge
In my work in infrastructure I often have to keep track of the status of many
third party serivces. This can be especially painful in an outage situation
where I much to check multiple dashboards to get a full picture of what may be
happening.

## Solution
This project is an experiment to consolidate multiple dashboards into a single
page that can be easily checked.

This is also to exercise my skills in FastAPI and teach myself htmx.

## Running

Using [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/) you can run the following commands:

`task`: Show all the tasks available via the Taskfile.yaml

* `task compose:dev`             Start Docker Compose services in development mode
* `task compose:down`            Stop Docker Compose services
* `task compose:logs`            View Docker Compose logs
* `task compose:up`              Start Docker Compose services
* `task docker:build`            Build the production Docker image for running the application
* `task docker:build-test`       Build the testing Docker image for unit testing
* `task docker:run`              Run Docker container
* `task docker:test`             Run unit tests inside the testing Docker container

Once the container is running, you can view the application at http://localhost:8000

## Configuring

* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit any values as needed

* `config.yaml` lists the services to be checked. For example:

```yaml
services:
  - name: "GitHub Status"
    type: "rss"
    config:
      name: "GitHub"
      feed_url: "https://www.githubstatus.com/history.rss"
      timeout: 30
    polling_interval: 300
```

At the moment, only RSS is supported
